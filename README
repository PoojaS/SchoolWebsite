Trying to build my own website using spring and hibernate.This app is basically a school website which will add new students to the DB which will be possible individually or through bulk upload of details through excel sheet.Also it will display the details of existing students using Ext-Js.

1.Required the jars cglib.jar(for proxy creation for @Transactional),asm.jar(dependency for cglib.jar),hibernate related jars,log4j slf4j jars,aopalliance.jar
2.Syntax for generating sequence in hsqldb

CREATE SEQUENCE MY_SEQ AS INTEGER
START WITH 1 INCREMENT BY 1;

CREATE TABLE STUDENT(
ROLLNO int GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY  PRIMARY KEY,
NAME varchar(50) NOT NULL ,
CLASS int,
SECTION varchar(4) );

The hbm required the generator type as sequence and also needed the sequence name(MY_SEQ) to be provided as a param.



How to set up the app

Starting hsqldb:
1.cd into hsqldb
2.run the following command from a terminal to start the server:
   java -cp lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.server.Server
3.run the following from another terminal to open the gui for the server
   java -cp ./lib/hsqldb.jar org.hsqldb.util.DatabaseManagerSwing

select HSQL Database Engine Server and connect to it.


Starting tomcat:
cd into apache-tomcat/bin and :
    Starting and stopping tomcat server
        starting:
          sh startup.sh
        stopping:
          sh shutdown.sh

    Starting tomcat in remote debug mode
        starting:
          sh catalina.sh jpda start
        stopping
          sh catalina.sh jpda stop
